# Jira Dark Theme

> Welcome to the dark side.

## Description

Simple Chrome extension, that applies dark theme to Jira.

## Installation

Download the code or clone the repo, activate developer mode in `chrome://extensions`,
and load the extension using `Load unpacked extension`.

I don't have any plans to publish this extension at the moment.
